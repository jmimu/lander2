Hi,
Here is my entry for 2015 competition: "Lander2".
It's a sequel to my 2013 entry "Lander1".

The purpose of the game is to make your rocket land safely on landing areas (horizontal with red dots) without using all your fuel.

How to play:
 - press 1 to start and pass texts
 - press 2 when you lost to restart from the first level
 - press down to decrease vertical speed
 - press left/right to change horizontal speed
Warning: acceleration is in the opposite direction of the direction you press!

I hope you'll enjoy it!
