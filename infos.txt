** Vertical scrolling :
variable Yscroll represents the position of the camera in the level (in pixels).
From 0 to 416 => 16 bit
VDP v-scroll value must be in [0;223]

make one inc file per level to declaire data and specific functions like init,
level mechanics, and what happends when hit special blocks

make a generic load data function using pile to get all adresses

last level : lava going up with 2 levels of palette hack : light then lava.
both with color loop ? Make the cave dark
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
each level has his onw SpecialTileFunction, called when touching a special case
(most of the time try to land and end en level).
SpecialTileFunction is a variable initialized at each level


function RunGame is strange no need to use palette0...


add tiles_vram_used in demo too

keep posY as 8.8 ? use it as local to screen ?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 3008 bytes for chars, divided by 4 using 1bpp tiles => 2256 bytes saved
 
 re-arrange rom to have data specific to a level in one file, and chers in an other,
 and be able to load chars using an other function
 
 3590 bytes for Brahms music
 2100 bytes for demo music
 4864 bytes for vertical level
 96 tiles for vertical level bg: 3072 bytes, if compressed : 2603 bytes
 demo sprites :  768, 559 if compressed
 demo tiles : 1536, 1075 if compressed
